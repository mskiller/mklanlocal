## Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Compose plugin)
- 4 GB RAM recommended for the worker (CLIP runs on CPU by default)
- The CLIP model (~600 MB) downloads from HuggingFace on first start and is cached persistently

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mklanlocal.git
cd mklanlocal

# 2. Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set **every value marked `CHANGE_ME`**:

```bash
# Generate a strong session secret
openssl rand -hex 32
# Paste the output as SESSION_SECRET in .env

# Set strong passwords for ADMIN_PASSWORD, CURATOR_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

```bash
# 3. Validate your .env before starting (recommended)
bash scripts/check-env.sh

# 4. (Optional) Mount your media folders — see "Adding Sources" below

# 5. Build and start
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build

# 5. Open the app
open http://localhost:3000
# Log in with your ADMIN_USERNAME / ADMIN_PASSWORD from .env
```

> **First run:** The stack takes ~2–3 minutes to build. The CLIP model downloads on the first scan (~600 MB, cached after that). Subsequent starts are fast.

---

## Adding Sources (Your Media Folders)

Media folders must be bind-mounted into both the `backend` and `worker` containers. Edit `infra/docker-compose.yml` and add your folders in both services:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      # ... existing volumes ...
      - type: bind
        source: /absolute/path/to/your/photos   # host path
        target: /data/sources/photos            # container path (must start with /data/sources/)
        read_only: true

  worker:
    volumes:
      # ... existing volumes ...
      - type: bind
        source: /absolute/path/to/your/photos   # same host path
        target: /data/sources/photos            # same container path
        read_only: true
```

**Windows paths** use forward slashes or escaped backslashes:

```yaml
source: C:/Users/YourName/Pictures
# or
source: C:\\Users\\YourName\\Pictures
```

After editing the compose file, restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Then go to **Admin → Sources → Add Source**, enter the container path (e.g. `/data/sources/photos`), and click **Scan**.

## Configuration

All settings live in `.env`. The most important ones:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | **Required.** Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Server won't start without it. |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Seed admin account created on first startup |
| `CURATOR_USERNAME` / `CURATOR_PASSWORD` | Seed curator account |
| `GUEST_USERNAME` / `GUEST_PASSWORD` | Seed guest account (read-only) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password |
| `CLIP_ENABLED` | `true` / `false` — disable if you don't need semantic search |
| `CLIP_DEVICE` | `cpu` (default) or `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU |
| `CLIP_MODEL_ID` | HuggingFace model ID (default: `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) |
| `MAX_THUMBNAIL_SIZE` | Max thumbnail dimension in pixels (default: `512`) |
| `DUPLICATE_PHASH_THRESHOLD` | Hamming distance for duplicate detection (default: `8`) |

Runtime settings (thumbnail size, CLIP thresholds, cache limits, poll interval) can also be adjusted live via **Admin → Settings** without restarting.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  └─▶ Next.js  :3000  (standalone output)
        └─▶ FastAPI  :8000  (proxied via Next.js rewrites)
              ├─▶ PostgreSQL :5432  (pgvector extension)
              └─▶ Worker  (scan · pHash · CLIP · previews · BlurHash)
                    └─▶ Mounted source folders  (read-only)
```

All four services run in Docker. The worker polls for pending scan jobs and processes files asynchronously — the UI stays responsive while large libraries index.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Can do |
|---|---|
| **admin** | Everything: sources, scans, users, groups, settings, backup/restore |
| **curator** | Browse, search, annotate, rate, review, manage collections, upload |
| **guest** | Browse and search only (read-only) |

Groups can override role permissions on a per-source basis (e.g. give a curator access to specific sources only).

---

## GPU Acceleration (optional)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU:

1. Install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
2. Set `CLIP_DEVICE=cuda` in `.env`
3. Add to the `worker` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: 1
          capabilities: [gpu]
```

---

## Development

### Backend (FastAPI + Python 3.12)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Start a local Postgres first (or use the Docker one on port 5432)
uvicorn media_indexer_backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Run migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Worker

```bash
cd worker
pip install -e .
python -m media_indexer_worker.main
```

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm run lint
npm run build   # production build check
```

---

## Backup & Restore

**Create a backup** (downloads as a ZIP):

```
GET /admin/backup
```

Or from the Admin UI: **Admin → Maintenance → Download Backup**.

The ZIP contains:
- `dump.sql` — full pg_dump
- `manifest.json` — alembic revision, app version, timestamps
- `checksums.sha256` — SHA256 of every file in the archive

**Restore:**

```
POST /admin/restore          # validates checksums then restores
POST /admin/restore?dry_run=true   # validate only, no changes
```

> ⚠️ Restore drops and recreates the database. Back up first.

---

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Alembic migrations run automatically on backend startup. They are idempotent and safe to re-run.

---

## Security Notes

### Pre-flight check
Run before every first deployment or after editing `.env`:
```bash
bash scripts/check-env.sh
```
This validates that all `CHANGE_ME` placeholders have been replaced and that passwords meet minimum length requirements.

### Secrets & passwords
- `SESSION_SECRET` **must** be set to a strong random value — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The server refuses to start with the default in any non-development environment.
- Passwords are hashed with **Argon2** (argon2-cffi). Plain-text passwords are never stored.
- Login is rate-limited to 10 attempts per minute per IP.

### Network exposure
- **PostgreSQL (port 5432)** is exposed on `0.0.0.0` by default in `docker-compose.yml`. On a LAN-only machine this is usually fine, but you should either restrict it to localhost or remove the port mapping entirely if you don't need direct DB access from outside the container network:
  ```yaml
  # Restrict to localhost only:
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
  ```
- The backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000) are similarly LAN-exposed. If you need to serve over the internet, put them behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Tailscale) with TLS and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in `.env`.

### Source path safety
- File paths are validated against `ALLOWED_SOURCE_ROOTS` on every request — path traversal outside mounted folders is rejected at the application layer.

### Backups
- `GET /admin/backup` produces a ZIP containing `dump.sql` — **this file contains all your data including hashed passwords**. Treat backup files like credentials:
  - Store them encrypted or in an access-controlled location.
  - Do not commit them to git (the `backup/` folder is already in `.gitignore`).
  - Delete old backups you no longer need.
- Backups include a `checksums.sha256` manifest. The restore endpoint validates all checksums before touching the database.
